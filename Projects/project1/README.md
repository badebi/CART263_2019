Van Gogh's Sisyphusesque Experience

It all started with the phrase "Empty Recycle Bin" while I was thinking about what actions in our daily life would be Sisyfusesque. Reading about Sisyphus's myth and Albert Camus's philosophy of absurd, what I was struggling with was the fact that I did not get that absurd vibe out of the story, in fact, I felt it should be some sort of wisdom hidden underneath its absurdness. What I believe is that his punishment was not absurd at all, and that is because, sooner or later, he will have a moment of realization which shifts his state of mind and expands his field of consciousness, hence he becomes more self aware. There are tons of wisdom that he could understand just by pushing the rock up the mountain and watch it rolling down. For example, he could acknowledge the importance of death and the reason why it is crucial that everything should have a beginning and an end (except The Creator himself), or maybe he could comprehensibly understand the true nature and effects of deceitfulness and craftiness, or self-aggrandizement. In my opinion, whenever there is a growth in something, there is no absurdness. Perhaps my way of thinking is because I believe in the principle of Causality, and the idea that advancing in the path of perfection to reach unity is the reason why human beings are in this earth.
